### Iâ€™m currently diving into:

* **Generative AI & LLMs:** Learning core concepts, prompt engineering, and utilizing APIs like Google's **Gemini** to build intelligent features.
* **JAClang (JAC):** Mastering this hyper-graph programming language to build complex, highly structured, and AI-powered applications efficiently.
* **Secondary Focus:** Python fundamentals,Data Structures.

### My Journey Starts Here:

| Repository | Focus | Tech Used |
